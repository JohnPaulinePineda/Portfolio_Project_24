This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_24/) explores the various dichotomization thresholding strategies for optimally classifying categorical responses. Using a Logistic Regression model structure, threshold criteria applied in the analysis to support optimal class prediction included Minimum Sensitivity, Minimum Specificity, Maximum Product of Specificity and Sensitivity, ROC Curve Point Closest to Point (0,1), Sensitivity Equals Specificity, Youden's Index, Maximum Efficiency, Minimization of Most Frequent Error, Maximum Diagnostic Odds Ratio, Maximum Kappa, Minimum Negative Predictive Value, Minimum Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value Equals Positive Predictive Value, Minimum P-Value and ROC Curve Point Closest to Observed Prevalence. The optimal thresholds determined for all criteria were compared and evaluated in terms of their relevance to the sensitivity and specificity objectives of the classification problem at hand.
